## 1. How to create a new branch to add functionality

for how to create a new branch the first thing we do is to enter the console and then what we do is to place the command since we know we are in the main branch we do a git branch contributions (we place the new name of the branch for example our branch will be called contributions) and after we do this we give enter and place the following command git branch and we look if the branch was created and in which we are already after this we make the command git checkout contributions we give enter (contributions is the name that we place to the branch) and with this we move to the branch where we are going to add functionalities with a commit and if you want to add it to the main branch you return with a checkout to the main branch and with a git merge you join the main branch with the contributions.

## 2. The naming convention for branches.

git branch (branch name) this is for creating branches 

git branch look and look for existing branches. 

git checkout (Branch name) this is for going into a specific branch 

git merge (Branch name) to merge the branches together 

git branch -d (Name of the branch) this is to remove the branch 

## 3. Steps to test the changes locally before committing them.

Now when we do our commit in the add, commit and push steps, we use the git status to review the changes and check the files.
