#How to create a new branch in git
To put it simply, the only thing you have to just have git installed, and through the cmd panel, you can do a lot of stuff, lets say that you already have
forked our repository, and have the local version, now you just need to write the next command in to the cmd panel
"git branch <name>"
And thats it, to switch to the branch that you just created just type
"git switch <name>"
##Naming Convention for branches
In this proyect, we wont use some extra special characters, just letters, preferably, lower case, no dashes or commas or a point. Like this examples
"git branch "-Green-Tech-Branch""
"git branch ".Green.Tech.Branch""
"git branch "GREENTECHBRANCH""
##How to test the canges before comitting
Remove the changes that you don't want to push. Easiest done by using "stash" first, then removing the changes.
Pull the latest state of the branch. Any conflicts are best handled at this time. Make sure that your code works with these changes.
Push your complete code. You always push what you have tested.
